### Notes

* Please use `stage.reyhoon.com` as host
* We care about _coding style_, _choosing external dependencies_, _your repo's history_, _your storyboard_, ... in selecting our colleagues from among the applicants. It is important for us if you care enough about these items too

### Acknowledgement

My deepest gratitude to our friends at [Reyhoon](//reyhoon.com) for their passion in designing their products.
