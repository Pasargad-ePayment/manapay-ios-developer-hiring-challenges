## iOS Challenge
![iOS Developer Hiring Challenge](img/01.png)

Hi,

We are looking for professional iOS developers to join our team. Instead of going through a ~~boring~~ long interview process, we decided that code often speaks for itself. If you're up to the challenge, please take an hour to play with these problems and submit your solutions.

### Submission

Please DO NOT submit a Pull Request!

If you've solved some of these, don't publish them as a fork of this repo, or it will spoil the fun for everyone else :-). You can create a public repo with a free Github account and after you're done, please send an email to [a.radmand@fanappayment.ir](mailto:a.radmand@fanappayment.ir) with the link to your repo so we can start talking =)

### Disclaimer

THIS IS NOT FREE WORK. Your proposal will only be used to evaluate the quality of your work and resourcefulness of your solution.

Regards,
